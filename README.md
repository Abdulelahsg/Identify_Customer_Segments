# Identify_Customer_Segments
### Install 
This project requires the following python libraries to be installed:<br />

*	NumPy 
*	Pandas 
*seaborn
*matplotlip
*StandardScaler
*PCA
*KMeans

I will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. 
These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. 
The data that I will use has been provided by at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
